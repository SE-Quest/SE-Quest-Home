#### [01] There are two Candles of equal length with diffrent thickness, Burns together. If 1st Candle takes 6 hour to burn completely and 2nd candle takes 4 hour to burn completely. Find how many hour 2nd Candle become half of the 1st Candle? (முதல் மெழுகுவர்த்தி பாதியாக மாறும் போது இரண்டாவது மெழுகுவர்த்தி எத்தனை மணி நேரம் எரிந்திருகும்)

 ANS: 3

#### Theoretical Explanation :

Candle 1 = 6 hour
 
### The answer can be find easily by dividing 6 hour(candle 1) by 2 gives 3 {6/2 = 3}
## ANS: 3
## When candle 1 become half 3 hour passes

#### [02] A Train Running at the speed of 60 km/hr crossed a pole at 9 seconds. Find length of the Train in meter?
  - 150m
  - 600m
  - 100m

### Explanation :-
  Speed = Distance / Time
  
  Distance =Speed x Time
  
  #### Here they give speed in km/hr and time in seconds so change km/hr(speed) to km/s they Ask answer in meter so its good to convert 'km/hr to m/s'
  1 km = 1000m

  1 h = 3600 s
  
  So 1km /h = 1000/3600 = 5/18 
  
  60km /h = (60 x 5) /18 
  
  Solution :
  
    Distance(Length of the Train) = (60 x 5 x 9) /18 = 150
    
  ## ANS: 150

#### [03] A Benz car travel 50% faster than Hyundai car. Both start at same point at same time and reaches end point at the same time and Both car cover 75km. On the way, however, Benz lost about 12.5 minutes on stopping in a station. the speed of the Hyundai car is? 
  - 100 km/s
  - 120 km/s
  - 90 km/s

### Explanation :-

  Speed = X
  
  Speed = Distance / Time
  
  Time = Distance / Speed
  
  For Hyundai:
  
    12.5 = 75 / X
    
  For Benz:
    
    12.5 = 75 / ((X x (100 + 50)) / 100)
    
    In the above Equation Hyundai car's speed is X which is 100 %. Benz is 50% faster than Hyundai. So 50 +100 = 150. Since it is in percentage we divide by 100. So we got ((X x (100 + 50)) / 100)

  To find the speed(X) negate Benz car's Equation to Hyundai's Equation.
  
    [75 / X] - [75 / (X x 150) / 100)] = 12.5
    
    [75 / X] - [(75 x 2) / 3X] = 12.5
    
    [75 / X] - [50 / X] = 12.5
    
    1/X [25] = 12.5
    
    Convert Minutes into seconds
    
    25 / x = 12.5 / 60 
    
    25 / x = 5 / 24
    
    X = 24 x 5
    
    X = 120 km/s

#### Speed of Hyundai car is 120 km/s.

## ANS: 120 km/s

#### [04] A is two years older than B who is twice as old as c. If total ages of A,B and c is 27. Find the age of B?
  - 10
  - 27
  - 12

### Explanation :-
 
  A = B + 2
  B = 2 x C
  C = B / 2
  
  A + B + C = 27
  B + 2 + B + (B / 2) = 27
  2B + 4 + 2B + B = 54
  5B = 54 - 4
  B = 50 / 5 = 10
  
#### Age of B is 10
## ANS: 10
