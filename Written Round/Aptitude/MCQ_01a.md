#### [02] A Train Running at the speed of 60 km/hr crossed a pole at 9 seconds. Find length of the Train in meter?
  - 150m
  - 600m
  - 100m

### Explanation :-
  Speed = Distance / Time
  
  Distance =Speed x Time
  
  #### Here they give speed in km/hr and time in seconds so change km/hr(speed) to km/s they Ask answer in meter so its good to convert 'km/hr to m/s'
  1 km = 1000m

  1 h = 3600 s
  
  So 1km /h = 1000/3600 = 5/18 
  60km /h = (60 x 5) /18 
  Solution :
    Distance(Length of the Train) = (60 x 5 x 9) /18 = 150
    
  ## ANS: 150
