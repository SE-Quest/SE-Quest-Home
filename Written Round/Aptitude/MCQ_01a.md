 ANS: 3

#### Theoretical Explanation :

Candle 1 = 6 hour
 
### The answer can be find easily by dividing 6 hour(candle 1) by 2 gives 3 {6/2 = 3}
## ANS: 3
## When candle 1 become half 3 hour passes

#### [02] A Train Running at the speed of 60 km/hr crossed a pole at 9 seconds. Find length of the Train in meter?
  - 150m
  - 600m
  - 100m

### Explanation :-
  Speed = Distance / Time
  
  Distance =Speed x Time
  
  #### Here they give speed in km/hr and time in seconds so change km/hr(speed) to km/s they Ask answer in meter so its good to convert 'km/hr to m/s'
  1 km = 1000m

  1 h = 3600 s
  
  So 1km /h = 1000/3600 = 5/18 
  
  60km /h = (60 x 5) /18 
  
  Solution :
  
    Distance(Length of the Train) = (60 x 5 x 9) /18 = 150
    
  ## ANS: 150

#### [03] A Benz car travel 50% faster than Hyundai car. Both start at same point at same time and reaches end point at the same time and Both car cover 75km. On the way, however, Benz lost about 12.5 minutes on stopping in a station. the speed of the Hyundai car is? 
  - 100 km/s
  - 120 km/s
  - 90 km/s

### Explanation :-

  Speed = X
  
  Speed = Distance / Time
  
  Time = Distance / Speed
  
  For Hyundai:
  
    12.5 = 75 / X
    
  For Benz:
    
    12.5 = 75 / ((X x (100 + 50)) / 100)
    
    In the above Equation Hyundai car's speed is X which is 100 %. Benz is 50% faster than Hyundai. So 50 +100 = 150. Since it is in percentage we divide by 100. So we got ((X x (100 + 50)) / 100)

  To find the speed(X) negate Benz car's Equation to Hyundai's Equation.
  
    [75 / X] - [75 / (X x 150) / 100)] = 12.5
    
    [75 / X] - [(75 x 2) / 3X] = 12.5
    
    [75 / X] - [50 / X] = 12.5
    
    1/X [25] = 12.5
    
    Convert Minutes into seconds
    
    25 / x = 12.5 / 60 
    
    25 / x = 5 / 24
    
    X = 24 x 5
    
    X = 120 km/s

#### Speed of Hyundai car is 120 km/s.

## ANS: 120 km/s

#### [04] A is two years older than B who is twice as old as c. If total ages of A,B and c is 27. Find the age of B?
  - 10
  - 27
  - 12

### Explanation :-
 
  A = B + 2
  B = 2 x C
  C = B / 2
  
  A + B + C = 27
  
  B + 2 + B + (B / 2) = 27
  
  2B + 4 + 2B + B = 54
  
  5B = 54 - 4
  
  B = 50 / 5 = 10
  
#### Age of B is 10
## ANS: 10

#### [05] The captain of foodball team of 11 members is 27 years old and vice captain is 3 years older than captain. If the ages of these two excluded, the average age of the remaining players is one year less than the average age of the whole team. What is the average age of the team?
  - 30
  - 27
  - 24

### Explanation :-
 
    Captain = c = 27

    Vice Captain = v.c = 27 + 3 = 30

    Average Age = avg = X

    11X - 27 - 30 = 9(X-1)

    11X - 57 = 9X - 9

    11X - 9X = 57 - 9

    2X = 48

    X = 24
  
#### Average Age of Whole Team is 24
## ANS: 24

#### [06] Two students are appearing at an examination one of them secure 7 marks more than the other and his mark wad 55% of the sum of their marks. What are the marks obtained by them? 
  - 38.5 and 31.5
  - 30 and 45
  - 45 and 55

### Explanation :-
  
    Consider two students as A & B

    A = B + 7

    A - B = 7

    55% - 45% = 10% => 7 [Given in Question, One person secure 10% or 7 mark more than other] 

    Total marks = X

    10% of X is 7

    (10 / 100)X = 7

    X = 70 {Total Mark}

    55% of 70 = 0.55 × 70 = 38.5 

    45% of 70 = 0.45 × 70 = 31.5

## ANS: 38.5 and 31.5
