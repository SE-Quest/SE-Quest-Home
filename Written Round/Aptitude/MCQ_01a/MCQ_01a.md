#### [01] There are two Candles of equal length with diffrent thickness, Burns together. If 1st Candle takes 6 hour to burn completely and 2nd candle takes 4 hour to burn completely. Find how many hour 2nd Candle become half of the 1st Candle. (முதல் மெழுகுவர்த்தி பாதியாக மாறும் போது இரண்டாவது மெழுகுவர்த்தி எத்தனை மணி நேரம் எரிந்திருகும்)

 ANS: 3

#### Theoretical Explanation :
  
Length = l

Candle 1 = 6 hour

Candle 2 = 4 hour

When Time pass Length decease -> l/X_hour

When Length of Candle become half -> l/2

solution (candle 1):

 => l/2 - l/6

 => (3l-l)/6

 => 2l/6

 => 2l = 6

 => l = 6/2

 => l = 3

   ## ANS: 3
### The answer can be find easily by dividing 6 hour(candle 1) by 2 gives 3 {6/2 = 3}
## When candle 1 become half 3 hour passes

#### [02] A Train Running at the speed of 60 km/hr crossed a pole at 9 seconds. Find length of the Train in meter.
  - 150m
  - 600m
  - 100m

### Explanation :-
  Speed = Distance / Time
  
  Distance =Speed x Time
  
  #### Here they give speed in km/hr and time in seconds so change km/hr(speed) to km/s they Ask answer in meter so its good to convert 'km/hr to m/s'
  1 km = 1000m

  1 h = 3600 s
  
  So 1km /h = 1000/3600 = 5/18 
  60km /h = (60 x 5) /18 
  Solution :
    Distance(Length of the Train) = (60 x 5 x 9) /18 = 150
    
  ## ANS: 150
