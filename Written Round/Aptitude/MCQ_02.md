#### [02] A group of friends went on a holiday to a hill station. It rained for 13 days. But when it rained in the morning, the afternoon was lovely. And when it rained in the afternoon, the day was preceded by clear morning. Altogether there were 11 very nice mornings and 12 very nice afternoons. How many days did their holiday last ?
  - 18
  - 13
  - 7
### Explanation :-
  
  The holiday last for 18 days.
  Rain in the morning and lovely afternoon = X days
  Clear morning and rain in the afternoon = Y days
  No rain in the morning and in the afternoon = Z days
  
  Number of days with rain => X + Y = 13 days      -------->(1)
  
  Number of days with clear mornings => Y + Z = 11 days      -------->(2)      
  
  Number of days with clear afternoons => X + Z = 12 days      -------->(3)
  
  Solving above 3 equations, we get **X = 7, Y = 6 and Z = 5**
  
  X + Y + Z = 7 + 6 + 5 = 18

### Their holiday last for 18 days.
## ANS: 18
